## Summary and Reflection

In this project, I built a Yahtzee game using Flutter, focusing on the dice rolling, score tracking, and game-ending mechanics. I ensured the code was structured to separate game logic from the UI, making it easier to manage and maintain. I also handled edge cases, such as preventing dice selection before rolling and fixing an issue where the score was being updated as zero before the first roll.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project, especially using Flutter's state management to keep the game interactive. The most challenging part was ensuring layout responsiveness across different screen sizes, but it was a valuable learning experience.
